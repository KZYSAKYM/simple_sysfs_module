# simple sysfs mod

## Description

This has been created on the purpose of education.

This is not the complete literature and code sample about creating sysfs files.

But, I believe this will help someone to learn how to control sysfs files.

## Build

```
$ make
$ sudo insmod simple_sysfs_mod.ko
```
